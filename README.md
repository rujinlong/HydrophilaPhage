This repository contains source code for the manuscript titled “**A
novel bacteriophage representing a putative new viral family rescues
largemouth bass from lethal *Aeromonas hydrophila* infection**”. This
project is structured as an R package to ensure reproducibility.

## Project Summary

*Aeromonas hydrophila* is a significant pathogen in aquaculture, causing
substantial economic losses. Bacteriophage therapy presents a promising
alternative to antibiotics for controlling this pathogen. This project
characterizes a novel phage, `vB_AhyM_Hp3`, isolated for its lytic
activity against *A. hydrophila*.

The repository includes the analyses for:

- **Biological Characterization**:
  - One-step growth curve to determine latent period and burst size.
  - Stability assays across different temperatures and pH levels.
  - Determination of the optimal Multiplicity of Infection (MOI).
  - In vitro bacterial lysis dynamics.
- **Therapeutic Potential**: An in vivo survival study in largemouth
  bass model to evaluate the phage’s efficacy as a biocontrol agent.

## Repository Structure

- `R/`: Contains the source code for the R package, including utility
  functions used in the analyses.
- `analyses/`: Contains Quarto documents (`.qmd`) for each step of the
  analysis. These documents are the core of the project, generating
  figures and results from raw data.
- `DESCRIPTION`: R package description file, listing dependencies and
  metadata.

  *Aeromonas hydrophila* is a common pathogen in aquaculture where antibiotic overuse has driven multidrug resistance. Phage therapy offers a promising alternative. In this study, we isolated and characterized a novel lytic phage, vB_AhyM_Hp3 (hereafter referred to as Hp3). Characterization of Hp3 revealed a potent lytic cycle with a latent period of approximately 45 minutes and high environmental stability across a wide range of temperatures (4-45°C) and pH (6.0-10.0). Whole-genome sequencing revealed an 84.75 kb double-stranded DNA genome with a GC content of 59%, confirming the absence of known antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes. Taxonomic and comparative genomic analyses indicate that Hp3 represents a distinct viral lineage, forming a putative new family within the class *Caudoviricetes* distinguished by a unique genomic signature including additional transcription regulation genes. The therapeutic efficacy of Hp3 was validated in a largemouth bass (*Micropterus salmoides*) infection model. A single administration at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0 rescued the fish from a lethal challenge, increasing the seven-day survival rate from 15% to 85%. Fish treated with the phage alone showed 100% survival with no pathology, demonstrating its safety for the host. Collectively, these findings establish phage Hp3 not only as a promising biocontrol agent for aquaculture but also as a valuable platform for engineering next-generation phage therapies.\par

# Introduction

*Aeromonas hydrophila*, a Gram-negative bacterium widely distributed in aquatic environments, represents a significant and escalating threat to global aquaculture [@2023-Review_Semwal]. As the causative agent of severe septicemic and ulcerative diseases in a broad spectrum of hosts, it is responsible for devastating outbreaks and substantial economic losses, particularly in the intensive farming of economically vital species like the largemouth bass (*Micropterus salmoides*) [@2006-Importance_Daskalov;@2021-MiRNAseq_Zhou;@2025-Vivo_Wang]. The industry's reliance on traditional antibiotics to control these infections is now a failing strategy. The rampant overuse of these drugs has not only driven the emergence of multidrug-resistant *A. hydrophila* strains, rendering treatments ineffective, but has also led to environmental contamination [@2025-Global_Jeamsripong]. This dual crisis of antimicrobial resistance and ecological damage creates an urgent need for effective and sustainable alternatives.

Bacteriophage therapy has emerged as a leading candidate to meet this need. Phages are natural predators of bacteria, offering a highly specific mechanism of action: they infect and lyse their target pathogen while leaving the host's beneficial microbiota undisturbed [@2019-Phage_GordilloAltamirano]. Unlike antibiotics, phages can be effective against biofilm-encased bacteria and are considered environmentally safe [@2023-Potential_Guo]. This precision and safety profile make them a powerful tool to combat bacterial pathogens in sensitive ecosystems like aquaculture [@2021-Phage_Ramos-Vivas].

However, the promise of phage therapy can only be realized through the rigorous discovery and characterization of suitable phage candidates. The path from environmental isolate to viable therapeutic agent is demanding, fraught with challenges such as environmental instability and the complex co-evolutionary dynamics between phages and bacteria. A comprehensive evaluation of a phage's lytic efficiency, stability, genomic safety, and, most critically, its efficacy in a relevant clinical model is required [@2025-Reevaluating_Cook;@2018-Phage_Torres-Barcelo]. This study was therefore undertaken to identify and comprehensively validate a novel phage against *A. hydrophila*. We report the isolation, multi-level characterization, and genomic analysis of phage vB_AhyM_Hp3 (Hp3), culminating in a successful demonstration of its therapeutic efficacy in a lethal largemouth bass infection model.

# Materials and Methods

## Bacterial Strain and Phage Isolation

The host bacterium, *Aeromonas hydrophila* strain MS01, was isolated in our laboratory from a diseased largemouth bass (*Micropterus salmoides*). Its species identity was confirmed via whole-genome sequencing. For host range analysis, nineteen additional *A. hydrophila* strains were used (@tbl-host-range). All strains were routinely cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at 37°C with shaking.  

Phage vB_AhyM_Hp3 (Hp3) was isolated from municipal sewage using an enrichment protocol. Briefly, a logarithmic-phase culture of *A. hydrophila* MS01 ($\mathrm{OD}_{600} \approx 0.5$) was incubated overnight with an equal volume of 0.22 μm-filtered sewage. The culture was then centrifuged (4000 × g, 20 min, 4°C), and the supernatant was filter-sterilized. A single phage plaque was isolated and purified through three successive rounds of the double-layer agar method to ensure clonal purity. High-titer phage stocks were prepared and stored at 4°C for subsequent experiments.

## Transmission Electron Microscopy Analysis

To visualize phage morphology, a high-titer phage suspension (approx. 10^9^ PFU/mL) was adsorbed onto a carbon-coated copper grid. The grid was then negatively stained with 3% (w/v) uranyl acetate and allowed to air-dry. Phage particles were examined using a Hitachi HT7800 transmission electron microscope to determine their ultrastructural characteristics.

## Phage Host Range Determination

To evaluate the lytic activity of phage Hp3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in aquaculture, nineteen *A. hydrophila* strains isolated from diseased fish in different geographical locations (@tbl-host-range) were retrieved from storage at -80°C and cultured in LB liquid medium at 37°C with shaking at 180 rpm. Following bacterial resuscitation, the host range of phage Hp3 was determined using standard spot assay.

## Determination of optimal Multiplicity of Infection (MOI)

A suspension of *A. hydrophila* in the late logarithmic growth phase was prepared as the test concentration. Phage Hp3 was added to the bacterial suspension at MOI of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10, 100, and 1000, and then incubated at 37°C for 3 hours. The co-culture was then centrifuged at 4000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane to remove bacteria. The filtrate was incubated with the *A. hydrophila* culture, and the phage titer was determined using the double-layer agar plate method. The MOI that produced the highest phage titer was considered the optimal MOI, which was used in subsequent experiments.

## One-Step Growth Curve

The one-step growth curve was performed to determine the latent period of Hp3. Phage Hp3 was added to the *A. hydrophila* suspension and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 4000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in fresh medium and incubated at 37°C with shaking at 180 rpm. Samples (200 μL) were collected at different time points, and the phage titer was determined using the double-layer agar plate method.

## Environmental Stability Assays

To assess thermal stability, phage stocks were incubated at various temperatures (4, 28, 37, 45, 60, and 80°C) for one hour. For pH stability, phages were incubated for one hour at 37°C in an SM buffer adjusted to pH values ranging from 4.0 to 12.0. Following incubation, the remaining viable phage titer in each sample was determined using the double-layer agar method. The experiment was repeated three times.

## *In Vitro* Lysis Assay

The lytic capability of Hp3 was monitored in a 96-well plate format. MS01 cultures were infected with Hp3 at different MOIs (0.01 to 100). The optical density at 600 nm ($\mathrm{OD}_{600}$) of the cultures was recorded every 20 minutes for 48 hours using an automated microplate reader. Uninfected cultures served as a negative control.

## Whole Genome Analysis

Phage DNA was extracted from the enriched phages using Norgen phage DNA kit (cat. 46800) following manufacturer instructions. The concentration and purity of DNA were determined using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The extracted phage DNA was sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. Raw sequencing reads were quality-controlled using fastp [@2018-Fastp_Chen], and then assembled using Unicycler v0.5.1 ([https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler)) to obtain the complete genome sequence.

The assembled complete genome was annotated using Pharokka v1.3.2 [@2022-Pharokka_Bouras], Phold v0.2 [@2025-Protein_Bouras] and Phynteny v0.1.13 [@2024-Susiegriggo_SusieGrigson]. For taxonomic classification, a proteomic network was constructed using vConTACT3 ([https://bitbucket.org/MAVERICLab/vcontact3](https://bitbucket.org/MAVERICLab/vcontact3)) against the NCBI viral RefSeq database (v230). The resulting network, which connects genomes sharing at least one homologous protein cluster, was visualized in Cytoscape [@2003-Cytoscape_Shannon]; a subgraph showing only viruses connected to Hp3 is presented (@fig-genomics B). Edge thickness in the network is proportional to the number of shared protein clusters.

For phylogenetic analysis, amino acid sequence of the terminase large subunit was used as a phylogenetic marker. Homologous sequences were retrieved via NCBI BLASTp. Comparative genome map was generated using clinker [@2021-Clinker_Gilchrist], displaying homologous gene pairs sharing >30% identity at the amino acid level. The absence of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes was confirmed by screening against the CARD [@2020-CARD_Alcock] and VFDB [@2019-VFDB_Liu] databases, respectively.

## *In Vivo* Therapeutic Efficacy in Largemouth Bass

Healthy largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were purchased from a commercial fish farm in Guangzhou (Guangdong Province, China). Upon arrival, the fish (average length 5.62 ± 0.52 cm; average weight 2.38 ± 0.31 g) were allowed to acclimatize to laboratory conditions for two weeks. During this period, they were housed in aerated tanks with a recirculating water system at 25 °C, pH of 6.8-8.0, and dissolved oxygen >5.7 mg/L and fed a commercial diet (Maoming Hailong Feed Co., Ltd.) twice daily. Twenty healthy largemouth bass in each group were intraperitoneally injected with 0.1 mL suspension of *A. hydrophila* at various concentrations of 1 × 10^6^, 1 × 10^7^, 1 × 10^8^, 1 × 10^9^, and 1 × 10^10^ CFU/mL. The fish were observed for seven consecutive days, and the cumulative mortality rate was recorded. The LD~50~ calculated using the modified Käber method was 4.47 × 10^7^ CFU/mL. Based on this, a bacterial concentration of 9 × 10^7^ CFU/mL was selected as the challenge dose for the formal experiment.

Eighty healthy largemouth bass were randomly divided into four groups of 20 each: the phage group, the bacterial group, the treatment group, and the PBS control group. In the phage group, 0.1 mL of PBS was injected intraperitoneally, followed by 0.1 mL of a phage Hp3 suspension (9 × 10^8^ PFU/mL) 1 hour later. In the bacterial group, 0.1 mL of *A. hydrophila* suspension (9 × 10^7^ CFU/mL) was injected intraperitoneally, followed by 0.1 mL of PBS 1 hour later. In the PBS group, 0.1 mL of PBS was injected intraperitoneally at 0 and 1 hour, respectively. In the treatment group, 0.1 mL of *A. hydrophila* suspension (9 × 10^7^ CFU/mL) was injected intraperitoneally, followed by 0.1 mL of a phage Hp3 suspension (9 × 10^7^ PFU/mL) one hour later.

After injection, fish in each group were housed in isolated water maintained at 25 ± 1°C. Daily survival was recorded for 7 consecutive days, and the cumulative survival rate was calculated to evaluate the *in vivo* therapeutic effect of the phage. Three days after infection, the liver and spleen tissues of fish in each group were collected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in conventional paraffin, and sliced (3 μm) for histopathological observation under an optical microscope after hematoxylin-eosin staining.

## Statistical analysis

Unless otherwise specified in the figure legends, all quantitative data from experiments with multiple replicates are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to plot survival curves, and the Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to determine the statistical significance of survival differences between the bacterial group and the treatment group. For bacterial growth (in vitro lysis) assays, differences in optical density between groups at the experimental endpoint (48 h) were analyzed using One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using R software (v4.5.1).

# Results

## Purification and Morphological Characterization of Phage Hp3

Hp3 forms single round, small, and transparent plaques with no lytic halo around them on a double-layer agar plate (@fig-hp3-morphology A). TEM revealed that Hp3 possesses an icosahedral head and a contractile tail, a morphology characteristic of the class *Caudoviricetes*. The head diameter is about 81 nm, the tail length is about 143 nm, and the width is about 23 nm. (@fig-hp3-morphology B)

## Hp3 Exhibits Potent Lytic Activity and a Narrow Host Range

The lytic spectrum of Hp3 was determined using 19 *A. hydrophila* strains (@tbl-host-range). Hp3 exhibited a narrow lytic range, successfully lysing only two bacterial strains.

## Hp3 Possesses a Rapid Lytic Cycle and Broad Environmental Stability

### Optimal MOI

The multiplicity of infection (MOI) refers to the ratio of phages that can be adsorbed to host bacteria within a specific period of time, and is an important indicator of phage infection experiments. In order to study the optimal multiplicity of infection of phages, this experiment set 7 MOIs (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10, 100, 1000). The results of the optimal phage MOI determination showed that when MOI=1.0, the titer of Hp3 reached the maximum (@fig-hp3-properties A).

### One-step growth curve of phage

The one-step growth curve revealed a latent period of approximately 45 minutes, followed by a burst phase of about 45 minutes, resulting in a complete lytic cycle of roughly 90 minutes. (@fig-hp3-properties B).

### Phage stability analysis

To assess its suitability for application, the stability of phage Hp3 was evaluated under various thermal and pH conditions. Hp3 demonstrated high thermal stability, maintaining a consistently high titer of approximately 10^8^ PFU/mL after a one-hour incubation at temperatures ranging from 4°C to 45°C. The phage's viability began to decline at 60°C, where the titer dropped by two orders of magnitude, and it was completely inactivated at 80°C (@fig-hp3-properties C).

Similarly, Hp3 exhibited robust stability across a wide pH range. The phage titer remained stable at approximately 10^8^ PFU/mL after one hour of incubation in buffers with pH values from 6.0 to 9.0. A moderate, one-log reduction in titer was observed at pH 10.0, while the phage was completely inactivated at pH values below 5.0 and above 11.0 (@fig-hp3-properties D). These results indicate that Hp3 is tolerant to the range of temperature and pH conditions commonly found in aquaculture environments.

### Phage lysis curve

To evaluate the lytic efficacy of Hp3 over time, we monitored its effect on the growth of *A. hydrophila* at various MOIs for 48 hours. As shown in @fig-lysis-curve, Hp3 demonstrated a significant dose-dependent antibacterial effect, maintaining the bacterial density below that of the untreated control throughout the experiment. At the 48-hour endpoint, the optical density in the different treatment groups showed statistically significant differences (One-way ANOVA, F(5, 15) = 23.191, p < 0.001). Notably, Hp3 exhibited the most effective and sustained bacterial suppression at an MOI of 1.0 and 10. In these conditions, an initial phase of bacterial growth was followed by a sharp decline in density, although regrowth was observed at later time points, likely due to the emergence of phage-resistant bacteria. Nevertheless, these results confirm the potent lytic capability of phage Hp3 and its potential for therapeutic use.

The experiment was repeated three times. The data are presented as the mean ± SD of three replicates.

## Genomic Analysis Reveals Hp3 Represents a Putative Novel Viral Family

Whole-genome sequencing revealed that phage Hp3 possesses a double-stranded DNA genome of 84,750 bp with a GC content of 59% (@fig-genomics A). Bioinformatic analysis predicted a total of 105 open reading frames (ORFs), of which 89 were assigned putative functions, while 16 were annotated as hypothetical proteins.  

To determine the taxonomic position of Hp3, we performed both phylogenetic and protein-sharing network-based analyses. Phylogenetic analysis based on the terminase large subunit protein placed Hp3 in a well-supported clade with *Aeromonas* phage HJ05 (GenBank accession OQ594355) as its closest known relative (@fig-genomics C). We then used vConTACT3 to compare the proteome of Hp3 against the NCBI viral RefSeq database. In the resulting network, where connections are based on shared homologous proteins, Hp3 formed a small, distinct cluster exclusively with phage HJ05 and another phage, vB_RleS_L338C (@fig-genomics B). This cluster was clearly separated from all established viral families, including its nearest neighbors in the *Peduoviridae* and *Straboviridae*. As both the NCBI database and vConTACT3 classify HJ05 as an unclassified member of the *Caudoviricetes*, our combined analyses strongly indicate that Hp3 represents a member of a putative novel viral family.  

A direct comparative analysis of phage Hp3 with HJ05 revealed a high degree of genomic identity and gene order conservation (synteny) across the majority of their genomes, confirming their close evolutionary relationship (@fig-genomics D). However, a notable difference exists at the 5' end of the genome, where Hp3 possesses a block of additional genes that are absent in HJ05. As shown on the circular map (@fig-genomics A, dashed rectangle), these extra genes are primarily annotated with functions related to "Transcription Regulation". This finding suggests that Hp3 may have evolved more sophisticated mechanisms for controlling its infection cycle compared to its closest known relative HJ05. This unique genetic signature, combined with its clear separation from other viral families in proteomic networks, provides compelling evidence for its classification as a representative of a novel taxon.  

Finally, a thorough safety assessment of the Hp3 genome confirmed the absence of genes associated with antibiotic resistance or known virulence factors, supporting its suitability for therapeutic applications.

## Phage Hp3 Rescues Largemouth Bass from a Lethal A. hydrophila Challenge

The in vivo experimental design is illustrated in @fig-therapy A, and the resulting survival curves for each group are shown in @fig-therapy B. In the phage-only group, intraperitoneal injection of a high dose of Hp3 resulted in 100% survival over 7 days, demonstrating the biosafety of the phage for the host. In contrast, the group infected with *A. hydrophila* began to exhibit mortality within 24 hours post-infection, and by day three, the survival rate had dropped to 15%, where it remained for the rest of the experiment. In the treatment group, however, administration of Hp3 one hour after infection resulted in a final survival rate of 85%. Statistical analysis confirmed that the survival rate in the treatment group was significantly higher than that in the bacterial group (Log-rank test, $\chi^2$ = 20.474, df = 1, p < 0.001).

Histopathological observations (@fig-therapy C-F) were consistent with the survival results. The liver and spleen structures of the PBS and phage control groups were intact, with no obvious lesions. The liver tissue of the infected group showed diffuse vacuolar degeneration, with swollen hepatocytes, nuclear displacement, blurred nuclear and cytoplasmic structures and cell boundaries, and irregular cell arrangement. Inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in the spleen tissue, with scattered necrotic foci in both the red and white pulp, and unclear boundaries of the parenchymal cells. In contrast, the tissue structure of the fish treated with Hp3 remained largely intact, with only a few focal vacuolar changes, which were significantly milder than those in the infected group. Taken together, these results indicate that Hp3 not only improves survival after infection with *A*. *hydrophila* but also significantly reduces liver and spleen damage in vivo.

# Discussion

In this study, we isolated and systematically characterized a novel lytic *Aeromonas hydrophila* phage, Hp3. Beyond its therapeutic potential, our genomic analysis reveals that Hp3 represents a novel viral lineage. Together with its closest relative, *Aeromonas* phage HJ05, it forms a distinct clade that falls outside any currently defined phage family within the *Caudoviricetes*, a finding that underscores the vast, unexplored phage diversity in aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, Hp3 possesses several attributes favorable for its development as an alternative to antibiotics in aquaculture. These include a short lytic cycle, robust tolerance to environmental stressors such as temperature and pH, and a genomic profile that confirms the absence of known genes associated with antibiotic resistance or virulence factors, providing a preliminary basis for its biosafety.

However, the long-term efficacy of any phage therapy is fundamentally dictated by the co-evolutionary "arms race" between the phage and its bacterial host [@2023-Developing_Oromi-Bosch]. This evolutionary pressure is manifested in two key findings of our study. First, the narrow host range of Hp3 reflects the highly specific interaction between phage receptor-binding proteins and specific bacterial surface molecules, which are the very structures bacteria constantly modify to evade predation. Second, the regrowth of the bacterial population observed in our in vitro lysis assays serves as direct evidence for the rapid emergence of resistant variants under phage selection pressure. Therefore, viewing Hp3 as a static antimicrobial agent would be short-sighted. Any successful application strategy must account for the evolutionary plasticity of the target bacteria.

This fundamental challenge points toward two complementary strategies widely considered in the field to outpace bacterial defenses. The first approach is to mimic natural diversity by formulating phage cocktails. Combining multiple phages that recognize different cellular receptors or employ distinct lytic mechanisms can significantly decrease the probability of simultaneous resistance emerging, thereby imposing a greater evolutionary hurdle on the pathogen [@2021-Phage_Abedon]. With its well-defined biological properties, Hp3 serves as a reliable foundational component for such multi-phage formulations. A second, more proactive strategy involves leveraging phage engineering [@2021-Reprogramming_Dunne]. Advances in structural biology and protein engineering offer a pathway to rationally modify the receptor-binding proteins of Hp3, potentially expanding its host range or enabling it to recognize newly evolved bacterial receptors, thereby directly countering the host's evolutionary trajectory.

A deeper layer of the arms race unfolds intracellularly, where bacteria deploy an array of defense systems, such as restriction-modification and CRISPR-Cas, to neutralize invading phage genomes [@2010-Bacteriophage_Labrie]. Phages, in turn, have evolved diverse anti-defense systems to bypass or inhibit these mechanisms [@2024-Growing_Murtazalieva]. Although our analysis did not identify known anti-defense genes in the Hp3 genome, this absence prompts a closer examination of unique genomic features that may serve analogous functions. A noteworthy feature in this context is the block of additional transcription regulation genes found in Hp3, which are absent in its relative HJ05. We hypothesize that these regulators may represent a novel or divergent anti-defense strategy, conferring an advantage by enabling a more rapid and efficient shutdown of the host's transcriptional machinery or by orchestrating a more finely tuned cascade of viral gene expression to counter bacterial defenses. This specific genomic difference not only strengthens the taxonomic distinction of Hp3 but also provides a concrete target for future functional studies, such as gene knockout experiments, to dissect the molecular mechanisms of phage-host antagonism. Such investigations are part of a broader research avenue to characterize the host's defense repertoire and discover novel anti-defense modules, which could then be used to engineer more sophisticated therapeutic combinations or be developed as standalone biologicals that disarm bacterial defenses.

Despite these long-term evolutionary considerations, the most critical finding of this study is the clear therapeutic efficacy of Hp3 in an *in vivo* model. A single administration of the phage significantly improved the survival of largemouth bass following a lethal challenge and effectively mitigated tissue pathology. This demonstrates that during the acute phase of an infection, a potent lytic phage can provide a decisive therapeutic advantage, winning a critical window of time for the host's immune system to clear the pathogen before resistance can become clinically relevant.

In conclusion, our characterization of phage Hp3 provides more than just a promising candidate for biocontrol. Its therapeutic potential is therefore best understood within the dynamic framework of phage-bacterium co-evolution, which reveals its dual value. Hp3 serves as both an effective agent for immediate consideration against *A. hydrophila* and, perhaps more significantly, as a platform for investigating the molecular arms race and engineering the next generation of intelligent, evolution-informed therapeutics.

# Conclusion

In this study, we isolated and characterized a novel lytic phage, Hp3, which effectively targets the aquaculture pathogen *A. hydrophila*. As a representative of a putative new family, Hp3 exhibits the rapid lytic kinetics, broad environmental stability, and safe genomic profile desirable for a therapeutic agent. We demonstrated its potent protective efficacy in a largemouth bass infection model, where Hp3 administration increased the survival rate from 15% to 85%. Collectively, our findings establish phage Hp3 not only as a promising antimicrobial agent but also as a valuable platform for the development of next-generation phage therapies against *A. hydrophila*.

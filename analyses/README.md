# Analysis Workflow

This directory contains the Quarto notebooks (`.qmd`) that form the
complete analysis workflow for the `HydrophilaPhage` project. The
notebooks are numbered to indicate the logical order of execution.

The primary analysis files are:

- `11-bacterial_genome.qmd`: Genome analyses of *Aeromonas hydrophila*
  MS01.
- `12-phage_genome.qmd`: Genome analyses of vB_AhyM_Hp3.
- `13-tree.qmd`: Phylogenetic analysis of terminase large subunit of
  vB_AhyM_Hp3.
- `21-figs.qmd`: Generates the primary figures for the manuscript based
  on wet-lab experimental data, including stability assays, growth
  curves, and in vivo experiments.

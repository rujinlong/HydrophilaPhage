# Analysis Workflow

This directory contains the Quarto notebooks (`.qmd`) that form the complete analysis workflow for the `HydrophilaPhage` project. The notebooks are numbered to indicate the logical order of execution.

The primary analysis files are:

-   `11-bacterial_genome.qmd`: Genome analyses of *Aeromonas hydrophila* MS01.
-   `12-phage_genome.qmd`: Genome analyses of vB_AhyM_Hp3.
-   `13-tree.qmd`: Phylogenetic analysis of terminase large subunit of vB_AhyM_Hp3.
-   `21-figs.qmd`: Generates the primary figures for the manuscript based on wet-lab experimental data, including stability assays, growth curves, and in vivo experiments.
